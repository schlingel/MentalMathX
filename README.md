MentalMathX
==========================
MentalMathX is a simple Android game which tries to focus on speed and more difficult exercises than other mental arithmetic trainer apps. As a bonus it's ad and spy free and you even get the source code. Isn't that great?

As it's a hassle to setup Android Studio from a project made with an older or even a newer version of AS, there's just a simple advise: try to import it. If that doesn't work you should look into the [Known Issues of AS](http://tools.android.com/knownissues). If that still doesn't work, feel free to contact me.
