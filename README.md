MentalMathX
==========================
MentalMathX is a simple Android game which tries to focus on speed and more difficult exercises than other mental arithmetic trainer apps. As a bonus it's ad and spy free and you even get the source code. Isn't that great?

As it's a hassle to setup Android Studio from sources made with an older or newer version of AS this just states: try to import it. If it doesn't you should look into the [Known Issues of AS](http://tools.android.com/knownissues) and if then still doesn't work contact me.
